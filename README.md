# moment.js-feel-with-date-fns-functionality
similar feel to moment.js functionality, but using date-fns.

An off by 4 hour error was frustrating me, so i used date-fns to replace moment.js, but I created a class to have the same feel as moment js so I can quickly replace code.

requirements:
  1. Node JS environment
  2. npm i date-fns
